## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Used Grid for the first time and combined it with flexbox. Used absolute positioning... which might not be ideal.

### Continued development

Since this project is a BIT larger in scope than the beginner ones, it was a bit hard to combine different element properties for different containers.
Lots of practice and knowledge will be nedeed to make websites more "modular".
